# üìà Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of Machine Learning models to predict stock prices for six major companies‚ÄîAgilent Technologies Inc. (A), American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP), Apple Inc. (AAPL), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).

We focus on predicting the **High** stock price using historical stock data and apply three ML models:  
- üü¶ Random Forest (RF)  
- üü© Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- üß† Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## üìä Dataset

Each CSV contains:
- **Features**: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `Dividends`, `Stock Splits`
- **Frequency**: Daily  
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and feature scaling before model training.

---

## üéØ Objective

Predict the `High` stock price using available features and compare the performance of RF, SVM, and ANN models.

## üß™ Models & Evaluation

The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance:
- **MAE** ‚Äì Mean Absolute Error  
- **MSE** ‚Äì Mean Squared Error  
- **RMSE** ‚Äì Root Mean Squared Error  
- **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äì Coefficient of Determination

### ‚úÖ Results Summary

| Model | MAE ‚Üì | MSE ‚Üì | RMSE ‚Üì | R¬≤ ‚Üë |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|------|
| Random Forest | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| SVM           | Higher  | Higher  | Higher  | Lower    |
| **ANN**       | **Lowest** | **Lowest** | **Lowest** | **Highest** |

üìå The **Artificial Neural Network** outperformed the other models, showcasing its strength in capturing complex, non-linear relationships in stock price behavior.
